# **Password Strength Checker**

A robust and intuitive Python-based tool for evaluating and improving the strength of passwords. The Password Strength Checker helps users create secure passwords by analyzing key characteristics and providing actionable feedback.

---

## **Features**
- Evaluates password strength as `Weak`, `Moderate`, or `Strong`.
- Checks for essential password requirements, including:
  - Minimum length.
  - Lowercase and uppercase characters.
  - Numeric and special characters.
- Offers tailored suggestions to improve weak or moderate passwords.

## **Setup**

### **Prerequisites**
- Python 3.7 or higher installed on your system.
- `pip`, Python's package manager.

### **Installation**
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/password-strength-checker.git
    cd password-strength-checker
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

---

## **Usage**

### **Interactive Demo**
Run the interactive demo to analyze passwords and get real-time suggestions:
```bash
python examples/demo.py
```

#### **Example Output**
```plaintext
Enter password to check (or 'q' to quit): weak

Password Strength: Weak

Suggestions for improvement:
- Add uppercase letters
- Add numbers
- Add special characters (!@#$%^&*)
- Make password at least 8 characters long
--------------------------------------------------
```

### **Programmatic Usage**
Use the `PasswordChecker` class in your Python project:
```python
from src.password_checker import PasswordChecker

checker = PasswordChecker()

# Analyze a password
password = "MyP@ssw0rd"
strength = checker.check_strength(password)
print(f"Password Strength: {strength}")

# Get improvement suggestions
if strength != "Strong":
    suggestions = checker.get_improvement_suggestions(password)
    print("Suggestions for improvement:")
    for suggestion in suggestions:
        print(f"- {suggestion}")
```

---

## **Testing**

Unit tests are included to validate the functionality. Use `pytest` to run tests:
```bash
pytest
```

#### **Example Test Cases**
- Weak password: `"weak"`
- Moderate password: `"Moderate1"`
- Strong password: `"Str0ng@Pass"`
